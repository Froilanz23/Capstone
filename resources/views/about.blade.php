          <p class=" mb-4">LikhaTala" is a compound word derived from two Filipino words: "Likha," which means "creation" or "to create," and "Tala," which means "star" or "to record." Together, "LikhaTala" can be interpreted as "Creation Star" or "Record of Creations." The name suggests a platform that showcases and celebrates creative works, symbolizing each artwork as a shining star, a beacon of inspiration and creativity. It implies that every creation is a noteworthy and valuable contribution, much like a star in the sky.

Just as stars guide travelers through the night, LikhaTala is designed to illuminate the path for artists, helping them thrive in the digital marketplace.
